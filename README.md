# xmasBot
Discord bot for playing songs h24 in a set of given voice channels.

For downloading songs the bot needs [DCA](https://github.com/bwmarrin/dca/tree/master/cmd/dca), [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

There are only two commands, that can be sent privately to the bot (and can only be used by user added to the config file):

`add <song link>` - Downloads the specified song.

`restart` - Restarts the bot. Useful if you have just added some songs.
